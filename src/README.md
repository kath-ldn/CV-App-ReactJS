Application Notes
- The spec/other user projects give the impression that this is an application to create and view a CV.
- I thought it might be a bit unique to create an online job-application form instead, which still meets the assignment spec.
- To me this felt more like something you'd see in the 'real-internet-world', so that's the direction I went in :-).

Version 1.0
- Functional, but very basic and unattractive

For version 1.1
- Form validation
- UX
    - Hide Education/Experience until General is complete
    - Provide ability to add more Education/Experience fields
    - Add final submission button and 'thank you for your application'
- CSS - make it look good.
    - Separate styles into files (importing to specific components) and add to styles folder if necessary.

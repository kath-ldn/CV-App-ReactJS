# React CV Application V1.1

## About

This is a simple CV App made with ReactJS. I made it for [The Odin Project, Javascript, React JS module, Project: CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript). The purpose of this was to practice key ReactJS concepts including state & props, and handling inputs/rendering lists.

I have styled it as if it were a form/app that you may see in, for example, a job or education application. It is currently at an early stage, please see below Roadmap for how I intend to develop this further.

## Roadmap

Current version functions and meets The Odin Project spec, but is very basic in terms of functionality and styling.

To develop in future versions:
* Form validation (either install package or write self);
* Hide subsequent sections of form until current is complete, and add progress bar;
* Ability to add more than one education/experience;
* Add final submission button and 'thank you for your application'.

### Known Issues

* None aside from improvements noted in Roadmap, let me know if you spot one.
